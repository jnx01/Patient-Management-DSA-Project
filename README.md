**Problem Statement:**

Develop a complete working application in C++ as a part of your DSA semester project. This may be an individual effort or a group contribution as per your personal preferences. In case of a group project, the maximum group size is to be two students only. Please ensure that your application should be a modular programming based solution to a problem employing the maximum concepts of Data Structure and Algorithms (like Stacks, Queues, Link List, Trees and Graphs).

**Project Description:**

Design and develop an application to automate a Corona Virus Patient Management System. The detail of the application is as below:
- Your application should have a proper login.
- Functionality to Add, Delete, Search and Modify records of the patient.

- A function that computes which city of the Pakistan contains more patient then other cities.
- A person must be declared Corona Virus Patient if the immune level is below the minimum level and symptoms are fever, dry cough, tiredness etc.
